Realm of Chaos submod for Victory Conditions Overhaul, Total War: Warhammer III.

## Introduction

This mod introduces a major redone of the victory conditions of Total War: Warhammer III Realms of Chaos campaign. A lot
of members of the community, including me, think that there is a poor job done in the default ones. This results in
abandoned campaigns and poor differences between factions, which usually feel all the same in a lot of races.

To use it you only have to subscribe to the mod in the Steam Workshop, as well as satisfying its dependencies. Using the
[VCO Framework](https://www.github.com/msolefonte/vco-framework/) is required and the compatibility is exactly
the same.

## Introduced changes

You can check the new victory conditions in the [Introduced changes](docs/README.md) file. There is a subfolder for each
faction improved.

## Frequently Asked Questions
