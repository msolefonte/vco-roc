IDEAS: 

Skrag idea: "Open Wide"

“The Maw’s Ferocity”: Control X number of Gorger, Sabertusk, and/or Stonehorn units

“The Ferocious Usurper”: Eliminate Greasus + control all major Ogre landmarks (might be too much but you seem to have an eye for balancing these kinds of things)

Hope these are helpful, and glad to see you bringing your talents to game 3 :)

p.s.: I might add more as I go through the list

p.s.s: Greasus ideas:

“Overtyrant’s Reign”: 

{insert dragon pun here}: Eliminate all Cathay factions

“Too Rich to Walk”: x gold goal like you suggested or

“Da Fattest in da Land!”: Kill Grom the Paunch for instant campaign victory (joking obviously, unless….👀)
