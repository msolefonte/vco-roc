## Ogre Kingdoms

### Greasus Goldtooth: Goldtooth

* **Route I - Too Rich to Walk**
    * 
* **Route II - Delicious Dragon Meat**
    * 
* **Route III - Overtyrant’s Reign**
    *

### Skrag the Slaughterer: Disciples of the Maw

* **Route I - An offering to the Great Maw**
    * 
* **Route II - TODO**
    * 
* **Route III - TODO**
    *
    
Skrag idea: "Open Wide" Feed X amount of food to the Maw.

“The Maw’s Ferocity”: Control X number of Gorger, Sabertusk, and/or Stonehorn units

“They Came from the Mountains” or “The Age of the Ogre”: Eliminate all Empire factions (add Kislev if this is too short?)

“The Ferocious Usurper”: Eliminate Greasus + control all major Ogre landmarks (might be too much but you seem to have an eye for balancing these kinds of things)

Hope these are helpful, and glad to see you bringing your talents to game 3 :)

p.s.: I might add more as I go through the list

p.s.s: Greasus ideas:

“Overtyrant’s Reign”: Eliminate or confederate all Ogre factions

{insert dragon pun here}: Eliminate all Cathay factions

“Too Rich to Walk”: x gold goal like you suggested or income goal

“Da Fattest in da Land!”: Kill Grom the Paunch for instant campaign victory (joking obviously, unless….👀)
