## N'Kari: Seducers of Slaanesh

* **Route I - The Great Game** // TESTED
    * Achieve the highest corruption in a minimum of 50 regions
* **Route II - Toxic Masculinity** // TESTED
    * Destroy factions:
        * Brazen Throne, Crimson Skull, Exiles of Khorne and Kharneth's Sons 
* **Route III - The Greatest Orgy**
    * TODO
    
Could be interesting to have either (a) have full cult coverage of every settlement of a major faction (probably kislev 
given start position?) or (b) X amount of cults in every major order faction. (a) isn't too cheesable since the ice 
court usually dominates the entirety of their continent by the time you get there, so you can either use military to 
occupy /raze their settlements to reduce the number of cults, amass a metric shit ton of devotees to use enough 
propagate cult actions to get cults in kislev, use agent actions - or most likely, a combo of all 3 (reduce settlement 
numbers, use propagate cults to cover what you can of kislev, then use the cult's 4th building to spawn more cultists 
that can create more cults in settlements that the random cults missed.
